# DBFM - Dark Background For Messenger
DBFM is a Firefox browser plugin that adds a dark theme to https://messenger.com site.
<br></br>
Currently, the plug-in is not developed much (except for fixing minor bugs) because the new Facebook page and application contain a dark theme. However, myself and many others are still using the old messenger page so people who want to report minor bugs or send PR with plugin improvements can do so in this repository.
